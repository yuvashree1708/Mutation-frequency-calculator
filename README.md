Mutation Frequency Calculator

A lightweight, open-source tool designed for analyzing mutation frequency in viral protein datasets. Built to parse residues position-wise from large viral genome sequences, this calculator helps researchers understand the plasticity of virusesâ€”how often residues change, and which regions remain stable or uncertain.

âœ¨ Features

Residue-wise parsing: Upload sequence files and automatically parse residues position by position.

Mutation frequency calculation: Quantifies how often amino acid residues differ from a reference across datasets.

Plasticity insights: Highlights how much of the viral protein is conserved vs. variable.

Ambiguity handling: Marks low-confidence areas (e.g., ambiguous residues) and nominally includes them in frequency calculations.

Customizable open-source code: Built from scratch and optimized for viral protein studies.

Interactive interface: Developed using Replit
 for easy access and usability.

ðŸ”¬ Use Case

This project was exclusively developed for viral protein research, enabling scientists to:

Detect hotspots of mutation in viral genomes.

Monitor conserved and variable regions across datasets.

Support downstream applications in vaccine design, drug target identification, and evolutionary studies.
